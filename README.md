 Eâ€‘commerce Web App

Iâ€™ve created a functional, responsive eâ€‘commerce prototype using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, showcasing key concepts in online shopping interfaces and dynamic UX design.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features:
âœ… Product catalog layout with product cards
âœ… Add-to-cart functionality with live cart updates
âœ… Dynamic cart summary (item count, subtotal, total)
âœ… Responsive design adaptable to desktop and mobile
âœ… Basic client-side interactions and real-time feedback

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack:

HTML for structured product and cart layouts

CSS for modern styling and responsive design

Vanilla JavaScript for cart logic and DOM manipulation

This project strengthened my skills in UI design, event handling, and state management in the front end.
